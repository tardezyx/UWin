# WinNoBS
A clean Windows with only the stuff that you want.

The approach is to create a general installable Windows Setup image for PCs and notebooks which automatically
- is free of every non-necessary and unwanted element (apps, features, services, tasks, etc.)
- provides software and features which you need and is not included in the standard installation
- protected from tracking and leaking privacy data
- applies customized settings for your productivity
- does not change itself without your permission

while keeping you able to adjust all changes to your personal needs by using free tools.
